Connect: the app has a community section for beekeepers to connect with other fellow beekeepers. Whether you want to give your advice and expertise to others, or share something new you've discovered, the app connects urban beekeepers from all around the globe together.

Bluetooth: the app has a bluetooth connection with our smart hive, from here, users could monitor the health of the bees inside the beehive. This is done through BLE.
